📚 Magic2U Documentation Overview

This folder contains the full documentation and visualization ecosystem for the Magic2U Design System. Each subdirectory represents a focused domain of the system — from governance and analytics to component documentation and page‑level structure. Together, they form a cohesive, scalable, and contributor‑friendly documentation architecture.

Magic2U’s documentation philosophy is simple:

    Clarity over complexity

    Narrative‑driven explanations

    Visual storytelling through analytics

    Consistent, predictable structure

    Design‑system alignment at every layer

This README provides a high‑level overview of each section.
📈 adoption-graphs/

Contains visual and narrative components that communicate design‑system adoption trends across the organization. These components help stakeholders understand growth, engagement, and long‑term system momentum.
📊 analytics-visualizations/

Houses KPI‑driven components such as:

    time saved

    economic impact

    engineering efficiency

These visualizations support executive storytelling and demonstrate the measurable value of Magic2U.
🧩 components/

Includes foundational documentation primitives such as:

    DocLayout — structural wrapper for documentation pages

    CodeBlock — styled code snippet renderer

These components ensure consistency and readability across all documentation surfaces.
🏛 governance/

Defines the governance model for the design system, including:

    review processes

    accessibility enforcement

    token approval workflows

    audit cycles

This section establishes the rules and structures that keep Magic2U stable, scalable, and high‑quality.
📄 pages/

Contains the page‑level wrappers used in the documentation site. Pages are intentionally minimal, delegating layout and content to feature modules. This keeps routing clean and predictable.
⚡ performance-dashboard/

Includes components that surface performance metrics, such as:

    bundle size

    first paint

    Lighthouse score

These metrics help teams understand the system’s technical efficiency and identify optimization opportunities.
🎨 token-viewer/

Provides components for inspecting design tokens, the atomic building blocks of the Magic2U visual language. Useful for debugging, onboarding, and validating theme changes.
🪄 Summary

This folder represents the documentation backbone of the Magic2U Design System. It blends:

    analytics

    governance

    component documentation

    design tokens

    page‑level structure

…into a unified, narrative‑driven ecosystem that is easy to navigate, easy to extend, and aligned with the architectural rigor of Magic2U.
