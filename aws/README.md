# aws
A monorepo to host and grow with my documentation of affiliating with AWS tools and topics.

> A company of companies

Have at least 9 different companies to build, you'll be surprised at how easily it's managed. 
Pick ideas each unique and that together tell an overall compelling story of your overall maturation and ability. 

> 9 companies

At the bare minimum. Some by default, at least 6 are your startups.
1 is your personal brand.

> Org chart

Do this even if it is ficticious.

This is our design system.
